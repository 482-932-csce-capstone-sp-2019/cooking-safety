# Virtual Reality Cooking Simulator

This document is intended to be used for people using the application. If you are looking for information on the development of this project, please check the [wiki](https://github.com/482-932-csce-capstone-sp-2019/cooking-safety/wiki) and the [source code](https://github.com/482-932-csce-capstone-sp-2019/cooking-safety).

### Welcome!

This application is designed to help people learn about proper food safety skills to practice in the kitchen. By using a virtual reality headset, we hope to make training costs cheaper and training more interactive for people who have to take food safety courses. While buying a virtual reality headset and the required components to run it seems more expensive, it is actually cheaper in the long run if many employees have to be trained for food safety since the cost of food, using a fully functional kitchen, and training labor costs can become costly. 

In its current state, this training helps people practice the following 4 things:

1. Preventing cross contamination of meats
2. Keeping hands clean in the kitchen
3. Putting out fires in a timely manner
4. Cooking meats to the appropriate temperature

In the future, this application could be expanded upon by implementing some of the following things:

- Keeping meats refridgerated
- Inspecting food for mold or disease
- More accurate interactions
- More recipes

### Requirements

To run this application you will need the following:

- A computer that is [VR capable](https://www.vive.com/us/ready/) running Windows with a spare HDMI port
- An HTC Vive headset
- Two Vive Controllers
- Minimum of 2m x 2m of open space
- Two Vive base stations in elevated positions (many people use tri-pod stands, but they can also be securely fastened to the wall)

### Setup

1. On your computer, install [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) and [SteamVR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/).
2. Set up the HTC Vive with your computer. This should happen automatically when it is plugged in. Please see the instructions that came with the HTC Vive for more information on setting that up.
3. From the SteamVR icon, launch Room Setup to calibrate your play space. When asked, please make sure to select the "Room-Scale" option.
4. Once this is complete, you can launch the simulator from the [exe file]()(change link to built version of the game).
5. Practice food safety skills!

NOTE: To ensure it works properly, we recommend using an HTC Vive. SteamVR has support for multiple different virtual reality systems. Our application was designed with this in mind, so it should be compatible with all other systems that SteamVR supports. However, given the small time frame of our project, we were not able to verify that this is true. To set it up other controllers, the SteamVR input mapping system should allow you to map our inputs appropriately.
